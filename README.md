# Predict-Student-dropout-and-Success-
Abstract

Predicting student dropout and academic success is a critical area of research in educational data science, aimed at improving student retention and institutional outcomes. This report explores the application of machine learning and statistical models to identify at-risk students and predict academic performance. By leveraging datasets encompassing demographic information, academic records, socio-economic factors, and behavioral patterns, predictive models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks are employed to forecast dropout risks and academic success. The report discusses key methodologies, including feature selection, model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score), and challenges such as data quality, ethical considerations, and model interpretability. Results from recent studies indicate that ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting achieve high predictive accuracy (80-90%) when combining academic and non-academic features. The findings underscore the importance of early intervention, personalized support systems, and the integration of predictive analytics into educational frameworks to enhance student outcomes.
Predictive Models

Several machine learning and statistical techniques are used:
Logistic Regression: Effective for binary outcomes (e.g., dropout vs. retention).
Decision Trees: Provide interpretable models but may overfit without pruning.
Random Forests: Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.
Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost): High performance in handling imbalanced datasets.
Neural Networks: Suitable for complex patterns but require large datasets and computational resources.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Useful for smaller datasets with clear class boundaries.
